## What is a NEAR Enhancement Proposal (NEP)?
A NEP is a design document for providing information to the NEAR community or describing a new feature for the NEAR protocol or Smart Contract standards. The NEP should provide a concise technical specification and a rationale for the feature.

NEPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new features, coordinating formal feedback, and documenting design decisions that were integrated into NEAR’s runtime or Smart Contract ecosystem.

As such, the NEP’s author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because NEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal. A list of NEPs is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/near/NEPs/).

## Motivation

The purpose of the NEP process is to ensure seamless protocol upgrades and to empower the community to contribute to the development of the NEAR platform. Given the complexity of the protocol and the large number of participants across the ecosystem, the process introduces working groups as a way to operationalize the review of NEPs that builds legitimacy and community support.

The working groups are responsible for coordinating the public review of NEPs, gauging the viability and community support, and overseeing decisions. Each group will focus on various ecosystem needs, such as the protocol, standards, and tools.

Pagoda has selected a few leading subject matter experts to help bootstrap the first two groups: Protocols and Contract Standards. Putting these groups into practice will require flexibility. The goal is to iterate and eventually introduce more groups and broader participation. Visit [https://near.org/working-groups](https://near.org/working-groups) to learn more about these groups, their members, and the upcoming meetings.

## Audience
The typical primary audience for NEPs are the core developers of the NEAR reference implementations and decentralized applications developers

## NEP Types
There are two kinds of NEPs:

1. A **Standards** NEP describes a new NEAR Smart Contract implementation standard.
2. A **Protocol** NEP describes a new feature for the NEAR protocol.

Currently, both types of NEPs follow the same process.

## NEP Workflow
### Start with an idea for NEAR
Everyone in the community is welcome to propose, discuss, and review ideas to improve the NEAR protocol and standards. The NEP process begins with a new idea for the NEAR ecosystem. A single NEP should contain a single key proposal or new idea.

Each NEP must have an author: someone who writes the NEP using the style and format described below. The author, or another champion, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums and attempts to build community consensus around the idea to help it progress toward completion.

Before submitting a NEP, the author should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is NEP-able. Vetting an idea publicly before writing a NEP saves the potential author time. Asking the NEAR community first if an idea is original helps prevent effort on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions. It also helps ensure the idea is applicable to the entire community. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most use cases.

In general, the process to socialize an idea is:

- **Check prior proposals:** Many ideas for changing NEAR come up frequently. Please search the [governance](https://gov.near.org/)[ ](https://gov.near.org/)[site](https://gov.near.org/) forums and NEPs in this repo before proposing something new.
- **Share the idea:** Join the [governance](https://gov.near.org/)[ ](https://gov.near.org/)[site](https://gov.near.org/) and make a post to the appropriate section. For instance, during the ideation phase of a standard, one might start a new conversation in the [Development](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/standards/29)[ » ](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/standards/29)[Standards](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/standards/29)[ ](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/standards/29)[section](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/standards/29). Similarly, during the ideation phase of a proposal to change the protocol, one might start a new conversation in the [Development](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/proposals/68)[ » ](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/proposals/68)[Proposals](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/proposals/68)[ ](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/proposals/68)[section](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/proposals/68).
- **Get feedback:** The forum has comment threading which allows the community and NEAR Collective to ideate, ask questions, wrestle with approaches, etc. If more immediate responses are desired, consider bringing the conversation [to](https://near.chat/)[ ](https://near.chat/)[Discord](https://near.chat/).

### Submit a NEP
Following the above initial discussions, the author should submit a draft NEP via a GitHub pull request. The draft must follow the NEP style as described below, else it will fail review immediately (although the moderators may correct minor errors).

The NEP workflow is:

- You, the NEP author, fork the NEPs repository, and create a file named neps/nep-9999.md that contains your new NEP. Use “9999” as your draft NEP number.
- Your first update is to change the nep filename to match the Pull Request number. For example, if the PR is 305, the NEP should be neps/nep-0305.md.
- In the “Type:” header field, enter “Standards” or “Protocol” as appropriate, and for the “Status:” field enter “Draft”. For full details, see NEP Header Preamble.
- Push this to your GitHub fork and submit a pull request.
- The NEP moderators review your PR for structure, formatting, and other errors. For a markdown-formatted NEP, nep-template.md is provided as a template.
  Approval criteria are:
  - The content is sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense. The moderators do not consider whether they seem likely for acceptance.
  - The title accurately describes the content.
  - The language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.) and code style are correct and conformant.
- If the NEP is not ready for approval, the moderators will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions in the pull request. The review by the moderators is expected to finish within one week.
- Once the moderators agree that the PR is ready for review, the moderators notify the approvers (working groups) to assign a team of at least two reviewers (subject matter experts) to review the NEP. The reviewers will review the technical details of the proposal and assess its merits. They may ask clarification questions, request changes, or reject the proposal. The review by the reviewers is expected to finish within one week. The author of the proposal is free to revise the proposal and re-request reviews from reviewers.
- If a proposal is in the review stage for more than two months, it is automatically rejected. To re-open the proposal, the author must start over with the NEP process again.
- Once the reviewers agree that the proposal is close to a decision, they will have a final two week review period to add their comments, and then ask the author to present the NEP to the working group in a meeting, where it can enter the final voting stage. If the moderators agree that the NEP is overall beneficial for the NEAR ecosystem and vote to approve it, then the proposal is considered accepted.

### NEP Maintenance
In general, NEPs are no longer modified after they have reached the Final state.

## NEP Life Cycle

![NEP Process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110252255/184407496-e96b0a96-af43-4694-90ed-58d8bb463958.png)

A given NEP can have one of the following states:

- **Draft**: The first formally tracked stage of a NEP in development. A NEP is merged by a NEP Moderator into the NEP repository when properly formatted.
- **Review**: A NEP moderator marks a NEP as ready for Subject Matter Experts Review. 
  - If the NEP is not approved within two months, it is automatically rejected.
- **Voting**: This is the final voting period for a NEP. The working group will vote on whether to accept or reject the NEP. This period is limited to two weeks. If during this period necessary normative changes are required, the NEP will revert back to Review.
- **Approved:** If the working group votes to approve, they will move the NEP to Approved. Once approved, Standards NEPs exist in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.
- **Rejected:** If the working group votes to reject, they will move the NEP to Rejected. 
- **Living** - A special status for NEPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably NEP-0001.

## NEP Roles and Responsibilities
The NEP process has various roles and responsibilities.

## What does a successful NEP look like?
Each NEP should have the following parts/sections:

1. Preamble - [RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt)[ 822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt) style headers containing meta-data about the NEP, including the NEP number, a short descriptive title, the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.
1. Summary - a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
1. Motivation - The motivation section should clearly explain why the existing contract ecosystem is inadequate to address the problem that the NEP solves. This can include collecting documented support for the NEP from important projects in the NEAR ecosystem. NEP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected.
1. Rationale and alternatives - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other platforms.
1. Specification - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of the contract or protocol feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for at least the current major NEAR version.
1. Reference Implementation - The reference implementation must be completed before any NEP is given the “Approved” status.
   While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of “rough consensus and running code” is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details. The final implementation must include test code and documentation. 
1. Security Implications - If there are security concerns in relation to the NEP, those concerns should be explicitly written out to make sure reviewers of the NEP are aware of them.
1. Drawbacks - Throughout the discussion of a NEP, various ideas will be proposed which are not accepted. Those rejected ideas should be recorded along with the reasoning as to why they were rejected. This both helps record the thought process behind the final version of the NEP as well as preventing people from bringing up the same rejected idea again in subsequent discussions.
   In a way this section can be thought of as a breakout section of the Rationale section that is focused specifically on why certain ideas were not ultimately pursued.
1. Unresolved Issues - While a NEP is in draft, ideas can come up which warrant further discussion. Those ideas should be recorded so people know that they are being thought about but do not have a concrete resolution. This helps make sure all issues required for the NEP to be ready for consideration are complete and reduces people duplicating prior discussion.
1. Future possibilities - Future possibilities describes any natural extensions and evolutions to the NEP proposal and how it would affect the project. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the project in your proposal. Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project and of the relevant sub-teams.
1. Copyright Waiver - All NEPs must be in the public domain. See the bottom of this NEP for an example copyright waiver.

## NEP Header Preamble
Each NEP must begin with an [RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt)[ 822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt) style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order.

```
  NEP: <NEP number>
  Title: <NEP title>
  Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addresses>  
  Status: <Draft | Review | Voting | Approved | Rejected | Living>
  DiscussionsTo (Optional): <URL of current canonical discussion thread or threads>
  Type: <Standards | Protocol>
  Requires (Optional): <NEP numbers>  
  Replaces (Optional): <NEP number>
  SupersededBy (Optional): <NEP number>
  Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
```
    
    
`Title`: The NEP title header should not be more than 4-5 words, describing   

`Author`: The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the NEP. The format of the Author header value must be 

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>; 
    Other I. User <address3@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

    Random J. User

`DiscussionsTo`: The DiscussionsTo header provides the URL to the current canonical discussion thread for the NEP.

`Type`: The Type header specifies the type of NEP: Standards or Protocol

`Created`: The Created header records the date that the NEP was assigned a number, should be in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 03-Mar-2022.

`Requires`: NEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the NEP numbers that this NEP depends on.

`SupersededBy`: NEPs may also have a SupersededBy header indicating that a NEP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the NEP that replaces the current document.

`Replaces`: A newer NEP marked with a SupercededBy header must have a Replaces header containing the number of the NEP that it rendered obsolete.

## Auxiliary Files
Images, diagrams and auxiliary files should be included in a subdirectory of the assets folder for that NEP as follows: assets/nep-N (where N is to be replaced with the NEP number). When linking to an image in the NEP, use relative links such as …/assets/nep-1/image.png

## Transferring NEP Ownership
It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of NEPs to a new author. In general, it is preferable to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred NEP, but that is up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the NEP process. A bad reason to transfer ownership is because the author does not agree with the direction of the NEP. One aim of the NEP process is to try to build consensus around a NEP, but if that is not possible, an author can submit a competing NEP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a NEP, you can also do this via pull request. Fork the NEP repository, make your ownership modification, and submit a pull request. You should mention both the original author and @near/nep-editors in a comment on the pull request.

## Style Guide

#### NEP numbers
When referring to a NEP by number, it should be written in the hyphenated form NEP-X where Xis the NEP’s assigned number.

#### RFC 2119
NEPs are encouraged to follow [RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)[ 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) for terminology and to insert the following at the beginning of the Specification section:

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
