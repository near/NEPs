## Summary

In essence, this NEP is extension of [NEP-40](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/Proposals/0040-split-states.md), which focused splitting one shard into multiple shards. 

We are introducing the second phase of resharding, which supports one shard splitting into two within one epoch at pre-determined split boundary. 

While the new approach addresses critical limitations left unsolved in NEP-40 and is expected to remain valid for foreseable future, it does not serve all usecases, such as dynamic resharding.

## Motivation

Currently, NEAR protocol has four shards. With more partners onboarding, we started seeing that some shards occasionally become over-crowded. In addition, with state sync and stateless validation, validators do not need to track all shards and validator hardware requirements can be greatly reduced with smaller shard size. 

## Specification

### High level assumptions

* Some form of State sync (centralized or decentralized) is enabled.
* Flat state is enabled.
* Shard split boundary is predetermined. In other words, necessity of shard splitting is manually decided.
* Merkle Patricia Trie is undelying data structure for the protocol.
* Minimal epoch gap between two resharding events is X.

### High level requirements

* Resharding should work even when validators stop tracking all shards.
* Resharding should work after stateless validation is enabled.
* Resharding should be fast enough so that both state sync and resharding can happen within one epoch.
* Resharding should not require additional hardware from nodes.
* Resharding should be fault tolerant
  * Chain must not stall in case of resharding failure.
  * A validator should be able to recover in case they go offline during resharding.
* No transaction or receipt should be lost during resharding.
* Resharding should work regardless of number of existing shards.

### Out of scope

* Dynamic resharding
* Shard determination logic (shard boundary is still determined by string value)
* TBD

### Required protocol changes

TBD. e.g. configuration changes we have to introduce

### Required state changes

TBD. e.g. additional/updated data a node has to maintain

### Resharding flow

TBD. how resharding happens at the high level

## Reference Implementation

TBD

## Security Implications

[Explicitly outline any security concerns in relation to the NEP, and potential ways to resolve or mitigate them. At the very least, well-known relevant threats must be covered, e.g. person-in-the-middle, double-spend, XSS, CSRF, etc.]

## Alternatives

* Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
  * TBD
* What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
  * TBD
* What is the impact of not doing this?
  * TBD

## Future possibilities

As noted above, dynamic resharding is out of scope for this NEP and should be implemented in the future. Dynamic resharding includes the following but not limited to:
* automatic determination of split boundary
* automatic shard splitting and merging based on traffic

Other useful features that can be considered as a follow up:
* account colocation for low latency across account call
* shard on demand

## Consequences

### Positive

* Workload across shards will be more evenly distributed.
* Required space to maintain state (either in memory or in persistent disk) will be smaller.
* State sync overhead will be smaller.
* TBD

### Neutral

* Number of shards is expected to increase.
* Underlying trie structure and data structure are not going to change.
* Resharding will create dependency on flat storage and state sync.

### Negative

* The resharding process is still not fully automated. Analyzing shard data, determining the split boundary, and triggering an actual shard split all need to be manually curated by a person.
* During resharding, a node is expected to do more work as it will have to apply changes twice (for the current shard and future shard).

### Backwards Compatibility

We do not expect anything to break with this change. Yet, shard splitting can introduce additional complexity on replayability. For instance, as target shard of a receipt and belonging shard of an account can change with shard splitting, shard splitting must be replayed along with transactions at the exact epoch boundary.

## Unresolved Issues (Optional)

[Explain any issues that warrant further discussion. Considerations

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the NEP process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this NEP that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this NEP?]

## Changelog

[The changelog section provides historical context for how the NEP developed over time. Initial NEP submission should start with version 1.0.0, and all subsequent NEP extensions must follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Every version should have the benefits and concerns raised during the review. The author does not need to fill out this section for the initial draft. Instead, the assigned reviewers (Subject Matter Experts) should create the first version during the first technical review. After the final public call, the author should then finalize the last version of the decision context.]
