## Summary

This NEP proposes a standardized interface for implementing vault contracts on the NEAR Protocol, drawing inspiration from the ERC-4626 standard widely used on Ethereum. A vault contract allows users to deposit an underlying fungible token (FT) into the vault, in exchange for which the vault issues shares that represent proportional ownership of the vault’s assets.

The underlying asset could be any NEP-141 compliant fungible token, such as a stablecoin or yield-bearing token. When deposited, the vault mints new shares to the depositor based on the current exchange rate between the vault’s total assets and total shares in circulation. Conversely, when a user redeems shares, the vault burns those shares and returns the equivalent amount of the underlying asset to the user.

The issued shares themselves are also NEP-141 compliant fungible tokens, enabling them to be freely transferred between accounts or traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This compatibility allows vault shares to be integrated into broader DeFi ecosystems, enabling use cases such as collateral in lending protocols, liquidity provision, or composable yield strategies.

By standardizing the vault interface, this NEP aims to improve interoperability, reduce integration costs, and encourage consistent, secure practices for vault implementation across the NEAR ecosystem.

## Motivation

Vault contracts are a fundamental building block in modern DeFi, enabling users to pool assets for yield generation, liquidity provision, or other strategies while receiving tokenized shares that represent their proportional ownership. However, without a standardized interface, each vault implementation on NEAR may expose different method names, return formats, and accounting mechanisms, creating unnecessary friction for developers, integrators, and auditors.

A consistent vault standard, inspired by ERC-4626, would provide multiple benefits:

-   Interoperability – Wallets, DEXs, lending protocols, and other DeFi applications can integrate with any compliant vault without custom logic for each implementation.

-   Reduced Integration Costs – Developers and projects save time and resources by building once against the standard interface rather than creating one-off integrations.

-   Ecosystem Growth – Standardized vaults make it easier for new projects to leverage existing liquidity and composability, accelerating adoption across the NEAR DeFi ecosystem.

By introducing this NEP, we aim to align vault design on NEAR with proven best practices from other blockchain ecosystems while optimizing for the unique features and requirements of NEP-141 fungible tokens.

## Specification

### Contract Interface

The contract should implement the VaultCore trait.

```rust
/// Specification for a fungible token vault that issues NEP-141 compliant shares.
///
/// A FungibleTokenVault accepts deposits of an underlying NEP-141 compliant asset
/// and issues NEP-141 compliant "shares" in return. These shares can be transferred
/// and traded like any other NEP-141 token.
///
/// This trait extends:
/// - [`FungibleTokenCore`] to provide NEP-141 functionality for shares.
/// - [`FungibleTokenReceiver`] to receive the underlying NEP-141 assets

    /// Useful for frontends to preview required shares for a given withdrawal.
    fn preview_shares_deducted_for_withdraw(&self, asset_amount: U128) -> U128;
}
```

### Deposit and Mint

```rust
pub trait FungibleTokenReceiver {
    /// # Events
    /// - The vault **must** emit a `VaultDeposit` event upon a successful deposit.
    /// - The vault should also emit a `FtMint` event for the share they issued.
    fn ft_on_transfer(&mut self, sender_id: AccountId, amount: U128, msg: String) -> PromiseOrValue<U128>;
}
```

-   According to the NEP-141 standard, all fungible token transfers to a contract must invoke the `ft_on_transfer` callback.
-   In the context of ERC-4626, both the **`deposit`** and **`mint`** functions are implemented through this entrypoint on the vault contract.
-   While NEP-141 does not prescribe how the `msg` parameter should be structured, our suggested convention is to pass a JSON-encoded message with the following schema:

```rust
pub struct DepositMessage {
    /// The minimum number of shares that must be received for this deposit to succeed. (Slippage control)
    min_shares: Option<U128>,
    /// The maximum number of shares that can be minted, used for `mint` operations.
    max_shares: Option<U128>,
    /// The account that should receive the minted shares.
    receiver_id: Option<AccountId>,
    /// Optional memo for logging or off-chain indexing.
    memo: Option<String>,
    /// If `true`, the transfer is treated as a donation and no shares are minted.
    donate: Option<bool>,
}
```

-   Implementers are free to define their own schema for `msg`, but the vault must correctly handle `ft_on_transfer` according to NEP-141:
-   Return `PromiseOrValue::Value(0)` if all tokens were accepted.
-   Return a non-zero `U128` to indicate the number of tokens to refund.

### Events

```rust
/// Event emitted when a deposit is received by the vault.
///
/// This follows the proposed NEP vault standard, referencing the ERC-4626 pattern.
/// Upon receiving assets, the vault mints and issues shares to the `owner_id`.
pub struct VaultDeposit {
    /// The account that sends the deposit (payer of the assets).
    pub sender_id: AccountId,

    /// The account that receives the minted shares.
    pub owner_id: AccountId,

    /// Amount of underlying assets deposited into the vault.
    pub asset_amount: U128,

    /// Amount of shares minted and issued to `owner_id`.
    pub shares: U128,

    /// Optional memo provided by the sender for off-chain use.
    pub memo: Option<String>,
}

/// Event emitted when shares are redeemed from the vault.
///
/// Upon redemption, the vault burns the shares from `owner_id`
/// and transfers the equivalent assets to `receiver_id`.
pub struct VaultWithdraw {
    /// The account that owns the shares being redeemed (burned).
    pub owner_id: AccountId,

    /// The account receiving the underlying assets.
    pub receiver_id: AccountId,

    /// Amount of shares redeemed (burned from the vault).
    pub shares: U128,

    /// Amount of underlying assets withdrawn from the vault.
    pub asset_amount: U128,

    /// Optional memo provided by the redeemer for off-chain use.
    pub memo: Option<String>,
}
```

## Reference Implementation

[Example implementation](https://github.com/Meteor-Wallet/tokenized-vault-nep-implementation).

## Security Implications

### Exchange Rate Manipulation

Vaults allow dynamic exchange rates between shares and assets, calculated by dividing total vault assets by total issued shares. If the vault has a permissionless donation mechanism, it creates vulnerability to inflation attacks where attackers manipulate the rate by donating assets to inflate share values, potentially stealing funds from subsequent depositors. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Vaults can also implement a virtual decimal offset for issued shares, making inflation attacks significantly less feasible, this is demonstrated in the reference implementation.

### Cross-contract Calls

Redeem and withdraw functions perform cross-contract calls to transfer fungible tokens, creating opportunities for reentrancy attacks and state manipulation during asynchronous execution. Vaults should implement reentrancy protection through proper state management, proper callback security, and rollback mechanisms for failed operations.

### Rounding Direction Security

Vault calculations must consistently round in favor of the vault to prevent exploitation. When issuing shares for deposits or transferring assets for redemptions, round down; when calculating required shares or assets for specific amounts, round up. This asymmetric rounding prevents users from extracting value through repeated micro-transactions that exploit rounding errors and protects existing shareholders from value dilution.

### Oracle and External Price Dependencies

Vaults that rely on external price oracles or cross-contract calls for exchange rate updates face additional security risks in Near's asynchronous environment. Oracle updates create temporal windows where vaults operate with stale pricing data, potentially allowing exploitation. Implementations should include staleness checks, prevent operations during oracle updates, implement proper callback security, and consider fallback pricing mechanisms for oracle failures.

## Alternatives

1. **Custom Per-Protocol Vault Implementations**
    - While possible, this leads to fragmentation, increases integration costs, and reduces composability between protocols.
2. **Direct ERC-4626 clone Without NEAR Adjustments**
    - Rejected because NEAR’s asynchronous execution model makes a one-to-one ERC-4626 clone inefficient. This proposal integrates share and vault logic in a single contract to avoid unnecessary cross-contract calls. Key Differences from ERC-4626 includes:
        - **Deposit & Mint**:
          Unlike ERC-4626, deposits and mints on NEAR must be handled through the
          `ft_on_transfer` callback (as defined by NEP-141), rather than direct method calls.
        - **Async Execution**:
          Since NEAR contracts execute asynchronously, results from `preview*` and `max*`
          view methods cannot be guaranteed to match the actual values during transaction
          execution. Cross-contract calls may be processed in later blocks, leading to
          differences between simulated values and actual outcomes.

## Future possibilities

### NEP-245 Multi Token Support

Future vault implementations could extend this standard to support NEP-245 Multi Token contracts as underlying asset. We have also created a [minimal implementation](https://github.com/Meteor-Wallet/tokenized-vault-mt-nep-implementation).

### Multi-Asset Vault Extensions

Future extensions could allow vaults to accept multiple assets for deposit and withdrawal. This would enable the standardization of LP vaults.

### Asynchronous Vault Operations

Future vault standards could introduce asynchronous deposit and withdrawal patterns through `request_deposit` and `request_withdraw` functions. This would enable integration with cross-chain protocols and real-world asset protocols.

## Consequences

### Positive

-   Enables a unified, predictable vault interface.

-   Simplifies integration for wallets, DEXs, and aggregators.

-   Improves security through consistent design and accounting.

-   Encourages reuse of tooling, libraries, and audits.

### Neutral

-   Standard defines interface, not yield strategy — implementation remains flexible.

-   Protocols may implement only relevant parts of the interface initially.

### Negative

-   Migration overhead for existing vault implementations to become compliant.

### Backwards Compatibility

-   No breaking changes to NEP-141 itself, but existing vault-like contracts that don’t conform will need to add or rename methods to comply.

-   Share tokens must be NEP-141 compliant, meaning non-NEP-141 share implementations require migration.
