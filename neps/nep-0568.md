## Summary 

This proposal introduces a new resharding implementation and shard layout for
production networks.

Resharding V3 is a significantly redesigned approach, addressing limitations of
the previous versions, [Resharding V1][NEP-040] and [Resharding V2][NEP-508].
The earlier solutions became obsolete due to major protocol changes since
Resharding V2, including the introduction of Stateless Validation, Single Shard
Tracking, and Mem-Trie.

The primary objective of Resharding V3 is to increase chain capacity by
splitting overutilized shards. A secondary aim is to lay the groundwork for
supporting Dynamic Resharding, Instant Resharding and Shard Merging in future
updates.

## Motivation

```text
[Explain why this proposal is necessary, how it will benefit the NEAR protocol or community, and what problems it solves. Also describe why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that this NEP solves, and what potential use cases or outcomes.]
```

## Specification

```text
[Explain the proposal as if you were teaching it to another developer. This generally means describing the syntax and semantics, naming new concepts, and providing clear examples. The specification needs to include sufficient detail to allow interoperable implementations getting built by following only the provided specification. In cases where it is infeasible to specify all implementation details upfront, broadly describe what they are.]
```

Resharding will be scheduled in advance by the NEAR developer team. The new
shard layout will be hardcoded into the neard binary and linked to the protocol
version. As the protocol upgrade progresses, resharding will be triggered during
the post-processing phase of the last block of the epoch. At this point, the
state of the parent shard will be split between two child shards. From the first
block of the new protocol version onward, the chain will operate with the new
shard layout.

There are two key dimensions to consider: state storage and protocol features,
along with a few additional details.

1) State Storage: Currently, the state of a shard is stored in three distinct
formats: the state, the flat state, and the mem-trie. Each of these
representations must be resharded. Logically, resharding is an almost
instantaneous event that occurs before the first block under the new shard
layout. However, in practice, some of this work may be deferred to
post-processing, as long as the chain's view reflects a fully resharded state.

1) Protocol Features: Several protocol features must integrate smoothly with the
  resharding process, including:

* Stateless Validation: Resharding must be validated and proven through
  stateless validation mechanisms.
* State Sync: Nodes must be able to sync the states of the child
  shards post-resharding.
* Cross-Shard Traffic: Receipts sent to the parent shard may need to be
  reassigned to one of the child shards.
* Receipt Handling: Delayed, postponed, buffered, and promise-yield receipts
  must be correctly distributed between the child shards.
* ShardId Semantics: The shard identifiers will become abstract identifiers
  where today they are number in the 0..num_shards range.

### State Storage - Mem Trie

### State Storage - Flat State

Flat State is a collection of key-value pairs stored on disk and each entry
contains a reference to its ShardId. When splitting a shard, every item inside
its Flat State must be correctly reassigned to either one of the new children;
due to technical limitations such operation can't be completed instantaneously.

Flat State main purposes are allowing the creation of State Sync snapshots and
the construction of Mem Tries. Fortunately, these two operations can be delayed
until resharding is completed. Note also that with Mem Tries enabled the chain
can move forward even if the current status of Flat State is not in sync with
the latest block. 

For the reason stated above, the chosen strategy is to reshard Flat State in a
long-running background task. The new shards' states must converge with their
Mem Tries representation in a reasonable amount of time.

Splitting a shard's Flat State is performed in multiple steps:

1) A post-processing 'split' task is created during the last block of the old
   shard layout, instantaneously. 
2) The 'split' task runs in parallel with the chain for a certain amount of
   time. Inside this routine every key-value pair belonging to the shard being
   split (also called parent shard) is copied into either the left or the right
   child Flat State. Entries linked to receipts are handled in a special way.
3) Once the task is completed, the parent shard Flat State is cleaned up. The
   children shards Flat States have their state in sync with last block of the
   old shard layout.
4) Children shards must apply the delta changes from the first block of the new
   shard layout until the final block of the canonical chain. This operation is
   done in another background task to avoid slowdowns while processing blocks.
5) Children shards Flat States are now ready and can be used to take State Sync
   snapshots and to reload Mem Tries.

### State Storage - State

// TODO Describe integration with cold storage once design is ready

Each shard’s Trie is stored in the `State` column of the database, with keys prefixed by `ShardUId`, followed by a node's hash.
This structure uniquely identifies each shard’s data. To avoid copying all entries under a new `ShardUId` during resharding,
a mapping strategy allows child shards to access ancestor shard data without directly creating new entries.

A naive approach to resharding would involve copying all `State` entries with a new `ShardUId` for a child shard, effectively duplicating the state.
This method, while straightforward, is not feasible because copying a large state would take too much time.
Resharding needs to appear complete between two blocks, so a direct copy would not allow the process to occur quickly enough.

To address this, Resharding V3 employs an efficient mapping strategy, using the `DBCol::ShardUIdMapping` column
to link each child shard’s `ShardUId` to the closest ancestor’s `ShardUId` holding the relevant data.
This allows child shards to access and update state data under the ancestor shard’s prefix without duplicating entries.

Initially, `ShardUIdMapping` is empty, as existing shards map to themselves. During resharding, a mapping entry is added to `ShardUIdMapping`,
pointing each child shard’s `ShardUId` to the appropriate ancestor. Mappings persist as long as any descendant shard references the ancestor’s data.
Once a node stops tracking all children and descendants of a shard, the entry for that shard can be removed, allowing its data to be garbage collected.
For archival nodes, mappings are retained indefinitely to maintain access to the full historical state.

This mapping strategy enables efficient shard management during resharding events,
supporting smooth transitions without altering storage structures directly.

## Reference Implementation

```text
[This technical section is required for Protocol proposals but optional for other categories. A draft implementation should demonstrate a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this proposal. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

* Its interaction with other features is clear.
* Where possible, include a Minimum Viable Interface subsection expressing the required behavior and types in a target programming language. (ie. traits and structs for rust, interfaces and classes for javascript, function signatures and structs for c, etc.)
* It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
* Corner cases are dissected by example.
* For protocol changes: A link to a draft PR on nearcore that shows how it can be integrated in the current code. It should at least solve the key technical challenges.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.]
```

### State Storage - State mapping

To enable efficient shard state management during resharding, Resharding V3 uses the `DBCol::ShardUIdMapping` column.
This mapping allows child shards to reference ancestor shard data, avoiding the need for immediate duplication of state entries. 

#### Mapping application in adapters

The core of the mapping logic is applied in `TrieStoreAdapter` and `TrieStoreUpdateAdapter`, which act as layers over the general `Store` interface.
Here’s a breakdown of the key functions involved:

* **Key resolution**:
  The `get_key_from_shard_uid_and_hash` function is central to determining the correct `ShardUId` for state access.
  At a high level, operations use the child shard's `ShardUId`, but within this function,
  the `DBCol::ShardUIdMapping` column is checked to determine if an ancestor `ShardUId` should be used instead.

  ```rust
  fn get_key_from_shard_uid_and_hash(
      store: &Store,
      shard_uid: ShardUId,
      hash: &CryptoHash,
  ) -> [u8; 40] {
      let mapped_shard_uid = store
          .get_ser::<ShardUId>(DBCol::StateShardUIdMapping, &shard_uid.to_bytes())
          .expect("get_key_from_shard_uid_and_hash() failed")
          .unwrap_or(shard_uid);
      let mut key = [0; 40];
      key[0..8].copy_from_slice(&mapped_shard_uid.to_bytes());
      key[8..].copy_from_slice(hash.as_ref());
      key
  }
  ```

  This function first attempts to retrieve a mapped ancestor `ShardUId` from `DBCol::ShardUIdMapping`.
  If no mapping exists, it defaults to the provided child `ShardUId`.
  This resolved `ShardUId` is then combined with the `node_hash` to form the final key used in `State` column operations.

* **State access operations**:
  The `TrieStoreAdapter` and `TrieStoreUpdateAdapter` use `get_key_from_shard_uid_and_hash` to correctly resolve the key for both reads and writes.
  Example methods include:

   ```rust
   // In TrieStoreAdapter
   pub fn get(&self, shard_uid: ShardUId, hash: &CryptoHash) -> Result<Arc<[u8]>, StorageError> {
      let key = get_key_from_shard_uid_and_hash(self.store, shard_uid, hash);
      self.store.get(DBCol::State, &key)
   }

   // In TrieStoreUpdateAdapter
   pub fn increment_refcount_by(
      &mut self,
      shard_uid: ShardUId,
      hash: &CryptoHash,
      data: &[u8],
      increment: NonZero<u32>,
   ) {
      let key = get_key_from_shard_uid_and_hash(self.store, shard_uid, hash);
      self.store_update.increment_refcount_by(DBCol::State, key.as_ref(), data, increment);
   }
   ```

  The `get` function retrieves data using the resolved `ShardUId` and key, while `increment_refcount_by` manages reference counts,
  ensuring correct tracking even when accessing data under an ancestor shard.

#### Mapping retention and cleanup

Mappings in `DBCol::ShardUIdMapping` persist as long as any descendant relies on an ancestor’s data.
To manage this, the `set_shard_uid_mapping` function in `TrieStoreUpdateAdapter` adds a new mapping during resharding:

```rust
fn set_shard_uid_mapping(&mut self, child_shard_uid: ShardUId, parent_shard_uid: ShardUId) {
    self.store_update.set(
        DBCol::StateShardUIdMapping,
        child_shard_uid.to_bytes().as_ref(),
        &borsh::to_vec(&parent_shard_uid).expect("Borsh serialize cannot fail"),
    )
}
```

When a node stops tracking all descendants of a shard, the associated mapping entry can be removed, allowing RocksDB to perform garbage collection.
For archival nodes, mappings are retained permanently to ensure access to the historical state of all shards.

This implementation ensures efficient and scalable shard state transitions,
allowing child shards to use ancestor data without creating redundant entries.

## Security Implications

```text
[Explicitly outline any security concerns in relation to the NEP, and potential ways to resolve or mitigate them. At the very least, well-known relevant threats must be covered, e.g. person-in-the-middle, double-spend, XSS, CSRF, etc.]
```

## Alternatives

```text
[Explain any alternative designs that were considered and the rationale for not choosing them. Why your design is superior?]
```

## Future possibilities

* Dynamic Resharding - In this proposal, resharding is scheduled in advance and hardcoded within the neard binary. In the future, we aim to enable the chain to dynamically trigger and execute resharding autonomously, allowing it to adjust capacity automatically based on demand.
* Fast Dynamic Resharding - In the Dynamic Resharding extension, the new shard layout is configured for the second upcoming epoch. This means that a full epoch must pass before the chain transitions to the updated shard layout. In the future, our goal is to accelerate this process by finalizing the previous epoch more quickly, allowing the chain to adopt the new layout as soon as possible.
* Shard Merging - In this proposal the only allowed resharding operation is shard splitting. In the future, we aim to enable shard merging, allowing underutilized shards to be combined with neighboring shards. This would allow the chain to free up resources and reallocate them where they are most needed.
