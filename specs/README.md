Nearnomicon contains the following information about the components of the NearProtocol client, with the goal to help
with the collaboration:

- High-level overview of the components and how they interact, including APIs;
- Data-structures;
- Things that are not yet implemented or replaced with temporary solutions;
- Assumptions that each component makes.
