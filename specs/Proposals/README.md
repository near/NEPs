## Proposals

This section contains the NEAR Enhancement Proposals (NEPs) that cover a fleshed out concept for NEAR. Before an idea is turned into a proposal, it will be fleshed out and discussed on the [NEAR Governance Forum](https://gov.near.org).

These subcategories are great places to start such a discussion:

- [Standards](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/standards/29) — examples might include new protocol standards, token standards, etc.
- [Proposals](https://gov.near.org/c/dev/proposals/68) — ecosystem proposals that may touch tooling, node experience, wallet usage, and so on.

Once and idea has been thoroughly discussed and vetted, a pull request should be made according to the instructions at the [NEP repository](https://github.com/near/NEPs).

The proposals shown in this section have been merged and exist to offer as much information as possible including historical motivations, drawbacks, approaches, future concerns, etc.

Once a proposal has been fully implemented it can be added as a specification, but will remain a proposal until that time.
