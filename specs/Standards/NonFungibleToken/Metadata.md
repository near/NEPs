# Non-Fungible Token Metadata ([NEP-177](https://github.com/near/NEPs/discussions/177))

Version `2.0.0`

## Summary

An interface for a non-fungible token's metadata. The goal is to keep the metadata future-proof as well as lightweight. This will be important to dApps needing additional information about an NFT's properties, and broadly compatible with other token standards such that the [NEAR Rainbow Bridge](https://near.org/blog/eth-near-rainbow-bridge/) can move tokens between chains.

## Motivation

The primary value of non-fungible tokens comes from their metadata. While the [core standard](Core.md) provides the minimum interface that can be considered a non-fungible token, most artists, developers, and dApps will want to associate more data with each NFT, and will want a predictable way to interact with any NFT's metadata.

NEAR's unique [storage staking](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/storage-staking) approach makes it feasible to store more data on-chain than other blockchains. This standard leverages this strength for common metadata attributes, and provides a standard way to link to additional offchain data to support rapid community experimentation.

This standard also provides a `spec` version. This makes it easy for consumers of NFTs, such as marketplaces, to know if they support all the features of a given token.

Prior art:

- NEAR's [Fungible Token Metadata Standard](../FungibleToken/Metadata.md)
- Discussion about NEAR's complete NFT standard: #171

## Interface

Metadata applies at both the contract level (`NFTContractMetadata`) and the token level (`TokenMetadata`). The relevant metadata for each:

```ts
type NFTContractMetadata = {
  spec: string, // required, essentially a version like "nft-1.0.0"
  name: string, // required, ex. "Mochi Rising — Digital Edition" or "Metaverse 3"
  symbol: string, // required, ex. "MOCHI"
  icon: string|null, // Data URL
  base_uri: string|null, // Centralized gateway known to have reliable access to decentralized storage assets referenced by `reference` or `media` URLs
  reference: string|null, // URL to a JSON file with more info
  reference_hash: string|null, // Base64-encoded sha256 hash of JSON from reference field. Required if `reference` is included.
}

type TokenMetadata = {
  title: string|null, // ex. "Arch Nemesis: Mail Carrier" or "Parcel #5055"
  description: string|null, // free-form description
  media: string|null, // URL to associated media, preferably to decentralized, content-addressed storage
  media_hash: string|null, // Base64-encoded sha256 hash of content referenced by the `media` field. Required if `media` is included.
  copies: number|null, // number of copies of this set of metadata in existence when token was minted.
  issued_at: number|null, // When token was issued or minted, Unix epoch in milliseconds
  expires_at: number|null, // When token expires, Unix epoch in milliseconds
  starts_at: number|null, // When token starts being valid, Unix epoch in milliseconds
  updated_at: number|null, // When token was last updated, Unix epoch in milliseconds
  extra: string|null, // anything extra the NFT wants to store on-chain. Can be stringified JSON.
  reference: string|null, // URL to an off-chain JSON file with more info.
  reference_hash: string|null // Base64-encoded sha256 hash of JSON from reference field. Required if `reference` is included.
}
```

A new function MUST be supported on the NFT contract:

```ts
function nft_metadata(): NFTContractMetadata {}
```

A new attribute MUST be added to each `Token` struct:

```diff
 type Token = {
   id: string,
   owner_id: string,
+  metadata: TokenMetadata,
 }
```

### An implementing contract MUST include the following fields on-chain

- `spec`: a string that MUST be formatted `nft-1.0.0` to indicate that a Non-Fungible Token contract adheres to the current versions of this Metadata spec. This will allow consumers of the Non-Fungible Token to know if they support the features of a given contract.
- `name`: the human-readable name of the contract.
- `symbol`: the abbreviated symbol of the contract, like MOCHI or MV3
- `base_uri`: Centralized gateway known to have reliable access to decentralized storage assets referenced by `reference` or `media` URLs. Can be used by other frontends for initial retrieval of assets, even if these frontends then replicate the data to their own decentralized nodes, which they are encouraged to do.

### An implementing contract MAY include the following fields on-chain

For `NFTContractMetadata`:

- `icon`: a small image associated with this contract. Encouraged to be a [data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs), to help consumers display it quickly while protecting user data. Recommendation: use [optimized SVG](https://codepen.io/tigt/post/optimizing-svgs-in-data-uris), which can result in high-resolution images with only 100s of bytes of [storage cost](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/storage-staking). (Note that these storage costs are incurred to the contract deployer, but that querying these icons is a very cheap & cacheable read operation for all consumers of the contract and the RPC nodes that serve the data.) Recommendation: create icons that will work well with both light-mode and dark-mode websites by either using middle-tone color schemes, or by [embedding `media` queries in the SVG](https://timkadlec.com/2013/04/media-queries-within-svg/).
- `reference`: a link to a valid JSON file containing various keys offering supplementary details on the token. Example: "/ipfs/QmdmQXB2mzChmMeKY47C43LxUdg1NDJ5MWcKMKxDu7RgQm", "https://example.com/token.json", etc. If the information given in this document conflicts with the on-chain attributes, the values in `reference` shall be considered the source of truth.
- `reference_hash`: the base64-encoded sha256 hash of the JSON file contained in the `reference` field. This is to guard against off-chain tampering.

For `TokenMetadata`:

- `name`:  The name of this specific token.
- `description`: A longer description of the token.
- `media`: URL to associated media. Preferably to decentralized, content-addressed storage.
- `media_hash`: the base64-encoded sha256 hash of content referenced by the `media` field. This is to guard against off-chain tampering.
- `copies`: The number of tokens with this set of metadata or `media` known to exist at time of minting.
- `issued_at`: Unix epoch in milliseconds when token was issued or minted (an unsigned 32-bit integer would suffice until the year 2106)
- `expires_at`: Unix epoch in milliseconds when token expires
- `starts_at`: Unix epoch in milliseconds when token starts being valid
- `updated_at`: Unix epoch in milliseconds when token was last updated
- `extra`: anything extra the NFT wants to store on-chain. Can be stringified JSON.
- `reference`: URL to an off-chain JSON file with more info.
- `reference_hash`: Base64-encoded sha256 hash of JSON from reference field. Required if `reference` is included.

### No incurred cost for core NFT behavior

Contracts should be implemented in a way to avoid extra gas fees for serialization & deserialization of metadata for calls to `nft_*` methods other than `nft_metadata` or `nft_token`. See `near-contract-standards` [implementation using `LazyOption`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs/blob/c2771af7fdfe01a4e8414046752ee16fb0d29d39/examples/fungible-token/ft/src/lib.rs#L71) as a reference example.

## Drawbacks

* When this NFT contract is created and initialized, the storage use per-token will be higher than an NFT Core version. Frontends can account for this by adding extra deposit when minting. This could be done by padding with a reasonable amount, or by the frontend using the [RPC call detailed here](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/front-end/rpc#genesis-config) that gets genesis configuration and actually determine precisely how much deposit is needed.
* Convention of `icon` being a data URL rather than a link to an HTTP endpoint that could contain privacy-violating code cannot be done on deploy or update of contract metadata, and must be done on the consumer/app side when displaying token data.
* If on-chain icon uses a data URL or is not set but the document given by `reference` contains a privacy-violating `icon` URL, consumers & apps of this data should not naïvely display the `reference` version, but should prefer the safe version. This is technically a violation of the "`reference` setting wins" policy described above.

## Future possibilities

- Detailed conventions that may be enforced for versions.
- A fleshed out schema for what the `reference` object should contain.

## Errata

The first version (`1.0.0`) had confusing language regarding the fields:
- `issued_at`
- `expires_at`
- `starts_at`
- `updated_at`

It gave those fields the type `string|null` but it was unclear whether it should be a Unix epoch in milliseconds or [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html). Upon having to revisit this, it was determined to be the most efficient to use epoch milliseconds as it would reduce the computation on the smart contract and can be derived trivially from the block timestamp.
