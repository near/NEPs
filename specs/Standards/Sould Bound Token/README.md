## Summary

Soulbound Token (SBT) is a form of a NFT which represents an aspect of an account (_soul_). Transferability is limited only to a case of recoverability or transferring the whole _soul_ - a `sbt_soul_transfer` should coordinate with a registry to transfer all SBTs from one account to another, and _killing_ the source account.

SBTs are well suited for carrying proof-of-attendance, proof-of-unique-human "stamps" and other similar credibility-carriers.

## Motivation

Recent Decentralized Society trends open a new area of Web3 research to model various aspects of what characterizes humans. Economic and governance value is generated by humans and their relationship. Creating a strong primitive is necessary to model new innovative systems and decentralized societies. Examples include reputation protocols, one-person-one-vote, fair airdrops & ICOs, universal basic income, non KYC identity systems, Human DAOs as well as methods for Sybil attack resistance.

We propose a SBT standard to model protocols described above.

_Verifiable Credentials_ (VC) could be seen as subset of SBT. However there is an important distinction: VC require set of claims and privacy protocols. It would make more sense to model VC with relation to W3 DID standard. SBT is different, it doesn't require a [resolver](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolvers) nor [method](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-methods) registry. For SBT, we need something more elastic than VC.

## Specification

Main requirement for Soubound tokens is to make it bound to a human:

- moving tokens from one account to another should be strictly limited to case of _recoverability_ (eg in case a user's private key is compromised due to extortion, loss, etc) or user account merge (_soul transfer_).
  This becomes especially important for proof-of-human stamps that can only be issued once per user.
- there should be an inherit cost when a token is moved. We propose an SBT registry, which will assure that a true _soul transfer_ is performed, and the source account will be blocked to house any new soul.

Atomicity of `soul_transfer` in current NEAR runtime is not possible if the token balance is kept separately in each SBT smart contract. To provide atomic transfer of all user tokens, we need additional contract: the `SBT Registry`.
// TODO: add more details about the registry.

Two safeguards against misuse of recovery are contemplated. 1) Users cannot recover an SBT by themselves. The issuer, a DAO or a smart contract (eg: multisig) dedicated to manage the recovery should be assigned. 2) Whenever a recovery is triggered then the Sould registry emits _SoulKill_ event (indicator that the account identity is burned). Recovering one SBT triggers registry blocklist that should apply for SBTs that share the same address.

Soulbound tokens can have an expire date. This is useful for tokens which are related to real world certificates with expire time, or social mechanisms (eg, community membership). Such tokens SHOULD have an option to be renewable. Examples include mandatory renewal with some frequency to check that the owner is still alive, or renew membership to a DAO that uses SBTs as membership gating.

### Smart contract interface

For the Token ID type we propose `u64` rather than `U128`. `u64` capacity is more than 1e19. If we will mint 10'000 SBTs per second, than it will take us 58'494'241 years to get into the capacity.
Today, the JS integer limit is `2^53-1 ~ 9e15`. It will take us 28561 years to fill that when minting 10'000 SBTs per second. So, we don't need to u128 nor a String type. However, if for some reason, we will need to get u64 support for JS, then we can always add another set of methods which will return String, so making it compatible with NFT standar (which is using `U128`, which is a string).

```rust
pub type TokenId = u64;
```

The Soulbound Token follows the NFT [NEP-171](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0171.md) interface, with few differences:

- token ID is `u64` (as discussed above).
- `TokenMetadata` doesn't have `title`, `description`, `media`, `media_hash`, `copies`, `extra`, `starts_at` nor `updated_at`. All that attributes except the `updated_at` can be part of the document stored at `reference`. `updated_at` can be tracked on blockchain.
- only NEP-171 Mint and Burn events are reused. Since we don't have normal transferability, we propose to use more targeted events, to better reflect the event nature.
  - TODO: since the native token ID is different in SBT and NFT, maybe we should use SBT special events for mint and revoke (burn)?

```rust
/// ContractMetadata defines contract wide attributes, which describes the whole contract.
pub struct ContractMetadata {
    pub spec: String,              // required, essentially a version like "sbt-1.0.0"
    pub name: String,              // required, ex. "Mosaics"
    pub symbol: String,            // required, ex. "MOSAIC"
    pub icon: Option<String>,      // Data URL
    pub base_uri: Option<String>, // Centralized gateway known to have reliable access to decentralized storage assets referenced by `reference` or `media` URLs
    pub reference: Option<String>, // URL to a JSON file with more info
    pub reference_hash: Option<Base64VecU8>, // Base64-encoded sha256 hash of JSON from reference field. Required if `reference` is included.
}

/// TokenMetadata defines attributes for each SBT token.
pub struct TokenMetadata {
    pub issued_at: Option<u64>, // When token was issued or minted, Unix epoch in milliseconds
    pub expires_at: Option<u64>, // When token expires, Unix epoch in milliseconds
    pub reference: Option<String>, // URL to an off-chain JSON file with more info.
    pub reference_hash: Option<Base64VecU8>, // Base64-encoded sha256 hash of JSON from reference field. Required if `reference` is included.
}


trait SBT {
    /**********
    * QUERIES
    **********/

    /// get the information about specific token ID
    fn sbt(&self, token_id: TokenId) -> Option<Token>;

    /// returns total amount of tokens minted by this contract
    fn sbt_total_supply(&self) -> u64;

    /// returns total supply of SBTs for a given owner
    fn sbt_supply_for_owner(&self, account: AccountId) -> u64;

    /// Query for sbt tokens
    fn sbt_tokens(&self, from_index: Option<u64>, limit: Option<u32>) -> Vec<Token>;

    /// Query sbt tokens by owner
    fn sbt_tokens_for_owner(
        &self,
        account: AccountId,
        from_index: Option<U64>,
        limit: Option<u32>,
    ) -> Vec<Token>;

    /// Optional. If the SBT implementaiton assures that one account can have maximum one SBT
    /// the the following function should be implemented.
    /// Returns Some(Token) if an `account` owns an SBT, otherwise returns None.
    fn sbt_token_for_owner(&self, account: AccountId) -> Option<Token> {}

    /*
    * Transactions are not part of the standard. Instead, in the section below, we provide
    * recommended interfaces for the functions which are related to the SBT Standard Events.
    **/

}
```

SBT smart contracts can implement NFT query interface to make it compatible with NFT tools. Note, we use U64 type rather than U128.

```rust
trait SBTNFT {
  fn nft_total_supply(&self) -> U64
  fn nft_tokens_for_owner(&self, account_id: AccountId, from_index: Option<U64>, limit: Option<u64>) -> Vec<Token>
  fn nft_supply_for_owner(&self, account_id: AccountId) -> U64
```

### Logs

```typescript
struct SbtEventKind {
  standard: "nep393";
  version: "1.0.0";
  event: "mint" | "recover" | "renew";
  data: Recover | Renew | SoulTransfer;
}

// Note: for token minting, NEP-171 compatible Mint event is used.

/// An event emitted when a recovery process succeeded to reassign SBT due to account access
/// loss. This action is usually requested by the owner, but executed by an issuer, and doesn't
/// trigger Soul Transfer.
/// Arguments
/// * `old_owner`: current holder of the SBT, whose account was compromised or lost.
/// * `new_owner`: destination account.
/// * `token_ids`: list of token ids.
/// * `memo`: optional message
struct Recover {
  old_owner: AccountId;
  new_owner: AccountId;
  tokens: []u64;
  memo: Option<string>;
}

/// An event emitted when a existing tokens are renewed.
/// Arguments
/// * `tokens`: list of token ids.
/// * `memo`: optional message
struct Renew {
  tokens: []u64;
  memo: string;
}

/// An evenet emitted when soul transfer is happening: all SBTs owned by `from` are transferred
/// to `to`, and the `from` account is _killed_ (can't receive any new SBT).
struct SoulTransfer {
  from: AccountId;
  to: AccountId;
  memo: Option<string>;
}
```

Whenever a recovery is made in a way that an existing SBT is burned, the `NftBurn` event must be emitted.

### Recommended functions

Although the transaction functions below are not part of the standard (depending on a use case, they may need different parameters), we recommend them as a part of implementation and we also provide them in the reference implementation.
These functions should emit appropriate events.

```rust

trait SBTTxs {

    /// Creates a new, unique token and assigns it to the `receiver`.
    /// Must emit NEP-171 compatible Mint event.
    /// Must provide enough NEAR to cover registry storage cost.
    /// The arguments to this function can vary, depending on the use-case.
    #[payable]
    fn sbt_mint(&mut self, metadata: TokenMetadata, receiver: AccountId);

    /// sbt_recover reassigns all tokens from the old owner to a new owner,
    /// and registers `old_owner` to a burned addresses registry.
    /// Must emit SbtRecover event.
    /// Must be called by an operator.
    /// Must provide enough NEAR to cover registry storage cost.
    #[payable]
    fn sbt_recover(&mut self, from: AccountId, to: AccountId);

    /// sbt_renew will update the expire time of provided tokens.
    /// `expires_at` is a unix timestamp (in seconds).
    /// Must emit SbtRenew event.
    pub fn sbt_renew(&mut self, tokens: Vec<TokenId>, expires_at: u64, memo: Option<String>);

    /// Revokes and burn SBT.
    /// Must emit NEP-171 compatible Burn event.
    /// Returns true if a token_id is a valid, active SBT. Otherwise returns false.
    pub fn sbt_revoke(token_id: uint64): bool;
}
```

## Example Flow

## Consequences

### Positive

- Template and set of guidelines for creating SBT tokens.
- Ability to create SBT aggregators.
- Ability to use SBT as a primitive to model non KYC identity, badges, certificates etc...
- SBT can be further used for "lego" protocols, like: Proof of Humanity (discussed for NDC Governance), undercollateralized lending, role based authentication systems, innovative economic and social applications...
- Standarized recoverability mechanism.
- SBT are considered as a basic primitive for Decentralized Societies.
- new way to implement Sybil attack resistance.

### Netural

- The API partially follows the NEP-171 (NFT) standard. The proposed design is to have native SBT API and also support NFT based queries.
  NOTE: we can decide to use `nft_` prefix whenever possible.

### Negative

- new set of events to be handled by the indexer.
- complexity of integration with a registry: all SBT related transactions must go through Registry.

## Considerations

Being fully compatible with NFT standard is a desirable. However, given the requirements related to _soul transfer_ we didn't find an applaudable solution. Also we decided to use u64 as a Token ID, diverging further from the NFT NEP-171 standard.

Give that our requirements are much striker, we need to reconsider the level of compatibility with NEP-171 NFT.
There are so many examples where NFT standards are poorly or improperly implemented, adding another standard with differing functionality but equal naming in there will cause lots of misclassifications between NFTs/SBTs, and then recover methods called on NFT contracts, SBTs attempted to be listed on NFT marketplaces and so on.
