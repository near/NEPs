# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Adding economics specification for NEAR Protocol based on the economics paper - https://nearprotocol.com/papers/economics-in-sharded-blockchain/

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Currently, the specification is defined by the implementation in https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore. This codifies all the parameters and formulas and defines main concepts.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

The goal is to build a set of specs about NEAR token economics, for analysts and adopters, to simplify their understanding of the protocol and its game-theoretical dynamics.
This initial release will be oriented to validators and staking in general.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This part of the documentation is self-contained. It may provide material for third-party research papers, and spreadsheet analysis.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

We might just put this in the NEAR docs.

This is an open document which may be used by NEAR's community to pull request a new economic policy. Having a formal document also for non-technical aspects opens new opportunities for the governance.
